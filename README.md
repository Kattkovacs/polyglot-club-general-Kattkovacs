# Polyglot club

## Story

A software developer may use up to 5-6 different languages during a typical workday.
The reason behind is simple: many projects are combination of different technologies. As you already know, different programming languages are suitable on the back end and the front end, some are more efficient for prototyping while others are better suited for production All in all, the question is:

> **Are you able to manage different languages for solving the same set of problems?**

May you haven't noticed but during the time you became a polyglot programmer.
So please join our mighty **Polyglot club** by solving some simple problems in three different languages!

## What are you going to learn?

You will learn and practice how to do the following things:

- solving the same problem in different languages
- comparing programming languages

## Tasks

1. Solve `Breaking chocolate problem` kata in three languages:
- `Python`
- `Javascript`
- your OOP language: `Java` or `C#`
    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page, (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>/completed`) named `screenshot#1.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has solved the kata _in three different languages_

2. Solve `Rotate for a max` problem in three languages:
- `Python`
- `Javascript`
- your OOP language: `Java` or `C#`
    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page, (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>/completed`) named `screenshot#2.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has solved the kata _in three different languages_

3. Solve `Complete the pattern #2` problem in three languages:
- `Python`
- `Javascript`
- your OOP language: `Java` or `C#`
    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page, (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>/completed`) named `screenshot#3.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has solved the kata _in three different languages_

4. Solve `Complete the pattern #4` problem in three languages:
- `Python`
- `Javascript`
- your OOP language: `Java` or `C#`
    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page, (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>/completed`) named `screenshot#4.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has solved the kata _in three different languages_

5. Solve `The old switcheroo` problem in three languages:
- `Python`
- `Javascript`
- your OOP language: `Java` or `C#`
    - There is a screenshot of the student's Codewars profile page, (`https://www.codewars.com/users/<username>/completed`) named `screenshot#5.jpg` pushed into the repository which shows that the student has solved the kata _in three different languages_

## General requirements

- The student has an account on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) coding platform.
- The student has set both languages (`Python`, `Javascript`, `Java` / `C#`) as `wish to train` in her [account settings](https://www.codewars.com/trainer/setup)

## Hints

- Try to solve 8 kyu katas first. You can start with
  [this collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/java-syntax-fundamentals),
  or use the [search feature](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/my-languages?q=&r[]=-8).
- You can train yourself by random katas by using the `Your next challange...`
  box on your [dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard). If you want to try
  harder katas, choose `Rank Up`, if you want to solidify your knowledge at a given
  level, choose `Practice and Repeat` from the dropdown.
- In case of `The old switcheroo` kata there is a connection between the vowels and their positions in the string
